# AlchemyBow.Core
AlchemyBow.Core is a simple dependency injection framework for Unity that I am actively improving during the development of my current personal project.
This version has been released for demonstration purposes. I'm going to release it as a documented package in the future.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy `AlchemyBow.Core` and `AlchemyBow.Core.meta` into the `Assets` folder of your project.
3. Add a reference to `AlchemyBow.Core` to appropriate assembly definitions. (If you don't use assembly deffinitions in your project, remove `AlchemyBow.Core/AlchemyBow.Core.asmdef`.)
